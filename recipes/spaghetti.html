        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Spaghetti is a classic Italian pasta dish, featuring long, thin noodles coated in a rich, savory tomato sauce. The sauce, often simmered with garlic, onions, and fresh herbs like basil, clings to each strand, creating a perfect balance of flavors in every bite. Finished with a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, itâ€™s a simple yet comforting meal that satisfies any craving.
